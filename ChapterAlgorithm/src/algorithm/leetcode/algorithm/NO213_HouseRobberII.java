 * 213. House Robber II
 * Note: This is an extension of House Robber.

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery 
so that he will not get too much attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. 
That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. 
Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
