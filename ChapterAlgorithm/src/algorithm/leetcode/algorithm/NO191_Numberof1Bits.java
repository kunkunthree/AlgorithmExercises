 * 191. Number of 1 Bits 
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has 
 * (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, 
 * so the function should return 3.
